The low resolution versions of the cruNCEP data here were created by subsampling
a subset of the full cruNCEP data.  

This was done to have a reasonably small file to use.  Here, the data files are 20-30MB instead of the 4.8GB of the original, full-resolution files.

Also, the netcdf format is much more convenient than the geoTIFF format used
in the originals.

Netcdf4 is used because unlike netcdf3, it can compress the data files.  
Otherwise, the data files would be too large to use with github, which
has a 100MB limit on individual file sizes.
